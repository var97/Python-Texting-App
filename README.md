Python Texting App Using Twilio API

In this project we are creating a Python Texting App using Twilio API

## Steps

- First of all Sign Up on [Twilio Website](www.twilio.com)
- Then on your dashboard you were provided with your Account_sid and Auth_token on the right hand side
- Then on Programmable SMS dashboard you will see a Get Started button click on it and get your twilio no.
- Then verify your cell no from your user settings.
- After that store your account_sid, auth_token, my_cell, my_twilio in the format that I have used in credentials.py
- Remember to download twilio package using **pip install twilio** in terminal:

1. Mac Users: Simply run this command on terminal

2. Window Users: Download gitbash and then run this on git bash terminal 
Or if you are using spyder you can run anaconda prompt and run **pip install twilio**

- After twilio package is installed then follow the format given in sent_sms.py and run that file accordingly

**Remember that TwilioRestClient module has been removed from the twilio package**
